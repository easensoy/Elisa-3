# Elisa-3

The Elisa-3 robot is an autonomous robot designed for swarm robotics research and experimentation. It is specifically developed for educational and research purposes, allowing users to explore swarm robotic algorithms and behaviors.

The Elisa-3 robot is also a small, low-cost robot equipped with various sensors and actuators. It features a circular shape and has a diameter of approximately 5 centimeters. The robot is equipped with infrared proximity sensors, light sensors, and an array of RGB LEDs. It also has two independently controlled wheels that enable it to move and navigate its environment.

More importantly, the Elisa-3 robot is capable of autonomous behavior, meaning it can operate without direct human control. It can perceive its surroundings using its sensors and make decisions based on programmed algorithms. The robot can execute tasks such as obstacle avoidance, light-following, swarm coordination, and other behaviors that are commonly explored in swarm robotics. In my project, I performed four different tasks such as: 

*Black line following in a simple track

*Black line following in a curved track

*Keep inside the box and avoid obstacles

*Line and corrider following

While the Elisa-3 robot is often used in swarm robotics research, it can also be used for individual robot experiments and projects. Its small size, affordability, and autonomy make it a suitable platform for learning and exploring robotics concepts.

In summary, the Elisa-3 robot from Gctronic is an autonomous robot designed for swarm robotics research and experimentation. It can operate independently, has various sensors and actuators, and is used to explore swarm robotics algorithms and behaviors.

The robot needed to achieve the four different tasks. All tasks are achieved by providing clockwise and counterclockwise motion.

Task 1


The first task is to track the black line by crossing the circle.

Task 2


The second one is a more complex task that requires it to traverse steep turns.

Task 3


The third task is about keeping inside the black frame while avoiding obstacles.

Task 4


The aim of the last task is to cross the junctions and follow the white corridor to reach the final line.
